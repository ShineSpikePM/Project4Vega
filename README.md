### Topic: Heart Attack Prediction
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection and prediction of heart attack risk can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates. In this project, we propose to develop a prediction algorithm to assess heart attack risk using the Heart Attack Prediction Dataset available on Kaggle.
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately assess an individual's risk of experiencing a heart attack based on various demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors.

We will be using Pandas and Tableau for project requirements.
